# galaxias
Sonorization and visualization of intergalactic journey based on CosmoHub data created during the Cuantica Hackathon at CCCB. Each circle corresponds to a galaxy. Its position is extracted from the data of that portion of the universe and the brightness is based on the galaxy luminosity. The notes are also based on luminosity data.
